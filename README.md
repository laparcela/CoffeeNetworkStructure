# CoffeeNetworkStructure
Codes for analising the robustness of an empirically known coffee-based network and randomized comparable networks

GetRobustness.ipynb contains a Python notebook with code to obtain the robustness of networks.
RobustezANOVAs.Rmd contains R notebook file with the statistical analyses of all robustness measures obtained with GetRobustness.ipynb
edgelistSinIndirectas is a csv file containing all the edges in the network wihtout HOIs
edgelistConAñadidas is a csv file containing all edges in the network with HOIs
Red_sinindirectas is the gephi file for the network without HOIs
Red_nodosañadidos is the gephi file for the network with HOIs
